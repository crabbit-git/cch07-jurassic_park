# What's this then?

It's just a simplistic model of a theme park which exhibits dinosaurs, represented in JavaScript. This was built via behaviour driven development, whereby some start code (which is available in `startpoint`) defined the desired behaviours for the Park model but not the tests themselves or the model for it. The model and some tests were already written for Dinosaur, a collection of which would need to be held within the Park.

# What can I do with it?

Not a whole lot. To do anything much at all, you'll at least need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org). If you have that installed, you can run the tests from a terminal to check whether they pass by installing the required dependencies...

`npm i`

... then running...

`npm test`

... and that's pretty much it, unless you want to mess around with the source code yourself, which you can do if you fancy. Just don't blame me if you break anything, awright? (Yeah, I know, no licence. I'm a simpleton. I know.)
